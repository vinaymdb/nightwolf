How will you troubleshoot packet drops? 5. What is TCP re-transmissions ? 6. What if there are no Packet drops/loss and high TCP re-transmissions on server. How will this impact server/services ? 7. What tools can be used to check bandwidth usage between 2 servers/devices. 8. When you poweron a laptop, how does it receives IP every time. Explain the process. 9. What if dhcp lease is over, will IP/connection drop from server. 10. What is APIPA. In what case Server gets APIPA ip? Hint: When server is configured to receive IP from DHCP and there is no DHCP in that network. 11. What happens in backend why you type google.com in browser and hit enter. 12. Explain recursive and Iterative DNS queries. 13. What can be the reason for receiving Request time outs when trying to resolve rackspace.com. 14. What are HOPs in network. In a packet-switching network, a hop is the trip a data packet takes from one router or intermediate point to another in the network. On the Internet (or a network that uses TCP/IP), the number of hops a packet has taken toward its destination (called the \"hop count\") is kept in the packet header. A packet with an exceedingly large hop count is discarded. 15. what is Apache 500 status code (Internel server error) and how to troubleshoot the 500 status code issue. 16. DNS working flow?

How to check if you are receiving connection timeouts when trying to connect to a server. 2. In what condition you will receive connection refused. Hint: 1. if packets are rejected using firewall/iptables action \"REJECT\" 2. If service is not responding or is down. 3. what will you do/check if customer calls and tells you that there is packet drop when he is trying to access a remote server. 4. How will you troubleshoot packet drops? 5. What is TCP re-transmissions ? 6. What if there are no Packet drops/loss and high TCP re-transmissions on server. How will this impact server/services ? 7. What tools can be used to check bandwidth usage between 2 servers/devices. 8. When you poweron a laptop, how does it receives IP every time. Explain the process. 9. What if dhcp lease is over, will IP/connection drop from server. 10. What is APIPA. In what case Server gets APIPA ip? Hint: When server is configured to receive IP from DHCP and there is no DHCP in that network. 11. What happens in backend why you type google.com in browser and hit enter. 12. Explain recursive and Iterative DNS queries. 13. What can be the reason for receiving Request time outs when trying to resolve rackspace.com. 14. What are HOPs in network. In a packet-switching network, a hop is the trip a data packet takes from one router or intermediate point to another in the network. On the Internet (or a network that uses TCP/IP), the number of hops a packet has taken toward its destination (called the \"hop count\") is kept in the packet header. A packet with an exceedingly large hop count is discarded. 15. what is Apache 500 status code (Internel server error) and how to troubleshoot the 500 status code issue. 16. DNS working flow?
